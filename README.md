# syntheticbiology

Code for Synthetic Biology lab module and accompanying work is presented. Peruse as you wish!

Included in this repository:
1. synbio.m --- sets up ODE functions governing genetic circuit
2. modelsyn.m --- use synbio.m to model varying condition of circuit
3. RMSE.m --- function calculating RMSE between two arrays
4. finite_difference_1d.m --- models diffusion in 1-D using finite difference
5. finite_difference_2d.m --- models diffusion in 2-D using finite difference
6. synthbio.ipynb --- normalizes and organizes pooled class data into strain_data.xlsx
7. strain_data.xlsx --- exported data from synthbio.ipynb containing model to which synbio is being fit
